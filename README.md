# Breast Cancer Detection  üêç
Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging advanced technologies, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Mammography, as one of the most common screening methods, provides detailed images of the breast tissue. The application of CNNs to mammogram analysis in Malaysia (MSIA) holds great promise for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection.
